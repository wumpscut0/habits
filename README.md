Methods in Markups having full access to control app. It`s central architecture idea.
For example, if working any callback, all what i must do in business logic: choose the method in Interface.
If i see state in Markup most likely i will must implement method for accept text.
If i see callback in Markup most likely i will must implement method with the name like callback-text data.
All communication between markups concludes in collect attribute-data from each other.
With open any markup by default text map making reset.
If i redefinition open method it's mean i want use attribute-data in other markup(s) or self.
That system help saving user interface in maximum clean with comfort using in client code.
If markup working with user input, it must definition state attribute.
State attribute can be only one and can not be change dynamic.
All private maps attributes can change only by owner class.
